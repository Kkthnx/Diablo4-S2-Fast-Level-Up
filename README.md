## Overview

Two distinct leveling routes are available for Diablo 4 Season 2 to cater to different playstyles and preferences. The choice between these routes depends on your personal preference and how you wish to experience the game.

### Route 1: Casual Players

This leveling strategy is designed to offer an enjoyable experience for casual players. It allows for exploration of the Overworld, granting Vampiric Powers, access to various crafting materials, improved gear, and legendary items. While not as fast as the "Race to 100" route, it provides fulfilling rewards.

#### The Steps

1. **Level 0:**
   - Create a new SEASONAL character on WORLD TIER 1. Experienced players or efficient groups can select WORLD TIER 2.

2. **Level 1-14:**
   - Claim Renown rewards in all 5 zones.
   - Embark on the Vampire Questline to acquire Vampire drops.

3. **Level 1-14:**
   - Prioritize Overworld leveling, with a focus on:
     - Legion Events
     - Completing Whispers, especially dungeon ones
     - World Bosses
     - BLOOD HARVEST
   - Acquire any codex powers needed from dungeons as you approach level 15.

4. **Level 15:**
   - Complete your class quest that automatically appears in your quest log.

5. **Level 16-48:**
   - Continue Overworld leveling with an emphasis on Legion Events, Whispers, and World Bosses.
   - Upgrade your main weapons at the blacksmith for increased DPS.
   - On Hardcore mode, craft an ELIXIR OF DEATH EVASION and bind your Scroll of Escape to a key.

6. **Level 48:**
   - Swap to World Tier 2 and clear the Capstone Dungeon.

7. **Preparation for the Next Chapter:**
   - Before ascending to World Tier 3, clear HOPE'S LIGHT STRONGHOLD to unlock FLOODED DEPTHS, one of the best Nightmare Dungeons.
   - Set up your endgame build in Kyovashad.

8. **Level 49-57:**
   - Return to the Overworld on World Tier 3, following the same strategy.
   - Prioritize HELLTIDE to obtain Forgotten Souls and Fiend Roses.

9. **Level 57-65:**
   - Chain-clear Nightmare Dungeons with the following hints:
     - Turn in Grim Favors to the Tree of Whispers to get a Nightmare Dungeon Sigil.
     - Complete the Nightmare Dungeon Quests in Kmart at the Occultist.
     - Ensure your Renown is completed before reaching World Tier 4.
     - Follow the Seasonal NM Dungeon Tier List for guidance on the best dungeons to run.
     - Salvage underperforming NM Dungeon keys according to the Tier List.
     - Pay attention to the Seasonal theme and seek important VAMPIRIC POWERS for your build.
     - Focus on Elites, high-density trash packs, and quick clears.
     - Run HELLTIDES and follow the mysterious chest strategy to obtain Forgotten Souls and Fiend Roses.
     - Defeat World Bosses when they appear.

10. **Level 65-68:**
    - At level 65 or when you feel ready, clear the second Capstone Dungeon.
    - Ascend to World Tier 4 at the statue in Kmart.

    - On Hardcore, have your ELIXIR OF DEATH EVASION ready.

11. **Level 68-100:**

    - Participate in Helltide for Forgotten Souls and Fiend Roses.
    - Reroll and upgrade your ancestral World Tier 4 gear.
    - Defeat World Bosses for loot and Shattering Prisms.
    - Ensure you have your optimal VAMPIRIC POWERS.
    - Challenge Uber Bosses when your resistances are capped and you feel powerful enough.

### Route 2: Fastest 1-50-100 Leveling for Racers

For those who want to achieve level 100 swiftly, the "Race to 100" route offers boosted XP rates. However, it sacrifices rewards for speed and focuses on running dungeons.

#### The Steps

1. **Level 0:**
   - Create a new SEASONAL character on WORLD TIER 1. Experienced players or efficient groups can select WORLD TIER 2.

2. **Level 1-15:**
   - Claim Renown rewards in all 5 zones.
   - Begin the Vampire Questline to acquire Vampire drops.

3. **Level 1-15:**
   - Focus on Domhainne Tunnels in Scosglen, but avoid freeing prisoners or progressing further.

4. **Level 15:**
   - Complete your class quest that automatically appears in your quest log.

5. **Level 16-48:**
   - Return to Domhainne Tunnels and maintain the same strategy.
   - Upgrade your main weapons for maximum DPS.
   - On Hardcore, have your ELIXIR OF DEATH EVASION and a bound Scroll of Escape ready.

6. **Level 48:**
   - At level 48, switch to World Tier 2 and conquer the Capstone Dungeon.

By following these routes, you can optimize your Diablo 4 Season 2 leveling experience based on your preferred playstyle.
